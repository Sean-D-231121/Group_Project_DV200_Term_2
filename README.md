## About the project:

### Built with:
This project is built with Node.js and React, as well as Javascript and appropriate css. Express.js and MongoDB were also used

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### How to install:

* React Bootstrap <br> `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
* React Router DOM <br> `npm i react-router-dom`
* Axios <br> `npm i axios`
* Bootstrap <br> `npm i bootstrap`
* Express <br> `npm i express`

## Features and Functionality:

In this project, users are greeted with sign-up and sign-in screens upon entering the application. The app features product screens where users can purchase items, leave comments, and add products to their cart. Additionally, users can create new products.

Users can sort products using various filters and add plants to their personal library. The app also allows users to create appointments for their plants.

The home screen displays user information, while the settings screen enables users to update their details.

## Concept Process:

### Ideation:

To create an intuitive and comprehensive web application that allows users to purchase products, manage their plants, and schedule appointments for plant care, all within a seamless user experience.

## Future Implementation

Community Features:
Expanding the application to include community features would greatly enhance user engagement and provide a platform for knowledge sharing. Users could join plant care communities based on their interests or the types of plants they own. These communities would allow users to share tips, ask questions, and provide support to each other. For instance, a user struggling with a particular plant could post a query and receive advice from more experienced plant enthusiasts. Additionally, the application could feature discussion boards, live chat options, and scheduled webinars or virtual meetups hosted by plant care experts. This social aspect would not only help users improve their plant care skills but also foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among plant lovers.

Advanced Analytics:
Incorporating advanced analytics into the application would provide users with valuable insights and personalized recommendations based on their activity. By analyzing user data such as purchase history, plant care routines, and engagement with the application, the system could offer tailored advice to enhance the user experience. For example, the application could suggest optimal watering schedules, fertilizer types, or alert users to seasonal care tips specific to their plants. Furthermore, these analytics could help users track their progress over time, identify patterns in plant health, and predict potential issues before they arise. This data-driven approach would empower users to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to healthier and more thriving plants.

Integration with Smart Devices:
Connecting the application with smart plant care devices represents a significant leap towards automated and precise plant management. These smart devices, such as moisture sensors, light meters, and automated watering systems, could be integrated with the application to provide real-time monitoring and care. Users would be able to receive instant notifications about their plants' needs, such as low moisture levels or insufficient light exposure. Additionally, the application could automate certain tasks, like adjusting light settings or initiating watering cycles, based on the data received from these devices. This integration would not only make plant care more convenient but also ensure that plants receive the exact care they need, leading to better growth and health outcomes. Furthermore, the application could compile data from these smart devices to offer users comprehensive reports on their plants' conditions, helping them to optimize their care routines.

## Conclusion
Botania represents a collaborative effort to create a cutting-edge web application that integrates product management and plant care functionalities in a seamless, user-friendly interface. Through our group's collective coding expertise and innovative thinking, we have developed an application that not only simplifies the shopping and plant care processes but also enriches the user experience.

From secure user authentication to advanced product browsing and plant management features, Botania provides users with a comprehensive tool for their gardening and shopping needs. Our future enhancements, including community features, advanced analytics, and smart device integration, promise to further elevate the application's functionality and user engagement.

The journey of developing Botania has been both challenging and rewarding, pushing us to hone our skills in front-end and back-end development, user interface design, and data integration. By leveraging modern technologies and adhering to best coding practices, we have built a robust and scalable platform that meets the diverse needs of our users.
